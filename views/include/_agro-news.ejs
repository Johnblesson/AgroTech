        <h2>1. Focus on Crop Rotation for Soil Health</h2>
        <p>To maintain soil fertility, practice crop rotation by alternating crops each season. For example, after harvesting rice, consider planting legumes such as cowpeas or groundnuts, which enrich the soil with nitrogen, essential for crop health. By rotating crops, you reduce the risk of soil depletion, lower pest infestations, and increase yield consistency.</p>
